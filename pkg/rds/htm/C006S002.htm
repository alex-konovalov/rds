<h1>6.2 Ordered signatures using representations</h1><p>
<p>
This section contains some methods for ordered signatures in ordinary
difference sets. Unfortunately, these methods are not as comfortable
as those for unordered signatures. The reason for this is simply that
I didn't have any time to tie them together to high-level functions.
If you need help here, don't hesitate to contact me.
