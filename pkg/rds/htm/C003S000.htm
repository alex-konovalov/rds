In this chapter, we first give a definition of relative difference
sets and outline a part of the theory. Then we have a quick look at
the way difference sets are represented in <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">RDS</font>.
<p>
After that, some basic methods for the generation of difference sets
are explained. 
<p>
If you already read chapter <a href="../../rds/htm/C002S000.htm">RDS:A quick start</a> and want to know what
<code>StartsetsInCoset</code> really does, you may want to read this chapter (and
the following one, of course). The main high-level function in this
chapter is <code>ExtendedStartsets</code>.
