The <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">RDS</font> package is meant to help with complete searches for
relative difference sets in non-abelian groups. Of course, it also
works for abelian groups, but no special features are implemented for
this case. In particular, there is no support for multipliers.
<p>
Furthermore, the focus is on difference sets defining projective
planes. So <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">RDS</font> contains some methods for analyzing projective
planes but has no support for other designs. Nonetheless other designs
may be constructed if they can be described in terms of  difference sets.
<p>
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">RDS</font> has no undocumented functions. While this is generally regarded
as a feature, it leads to a quite long manual and a lot of
documentation not needed for everyday work. So each chapter has a
short introduction helping you to distinguish the ``interesting'' features
from the ``uninteresting'' ones.
<p>
For a quick overview, see chapter <a href="../../rds/htm/C002S000.htm">RDS:A quick start</a>.
<p>
The package is entirely written in <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>. So it should run on every
computer that runs <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>.
