This chapter contains an important tool for the generation of
difference sets. It is called the ``coset signature'' and is an
invariant for equivalence of partial relative difference sets.  For
large &#955;, there is an invariant calculated by
<code>MultiplicityInvariantLargeLambda</code>. This invariant can be used
complementary to the coset signature and is explained in section
<a href="C006S001.htm">Ordered signatures by quotient images</a>.
<p>
Most of the methods explained here are not commonly used. If you do
not want to know how coset signatures work in detail, you can safely
skip a large part of this and go straight to the explanation of
<code>SignatureDataForNormalSubgroups</code> and <code>ReducedStartsets</code>.
<p>
The last section (<a href="../../rds/htm/C004S002.htm">RDS:Blackbox functions</a>) of this chapter has some
functions which allow the user to use coset signatures with even less
effort. But be aware that these functions make choices for you that
you probably do not want if you do very involved calculations. In
particular, the coset signatures are not stored globally and hence
cannot be reused. For a demonstration of these easy-to-use functions,
see chapter <a href="../../rds/htm/C002S000.htm">RDS:A quick start</a>
