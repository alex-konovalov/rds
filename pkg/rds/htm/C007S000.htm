The methods in this chapter do not deal with relative difference
sets. Instead, they help studying projective planes. So if you have a
relative difference set, you must first generate the projective plane
it defines (if it does).
<p>
Projective planes are always assumed to consist of positive integers
(as points) and sets of integers (as blocks). The incidence relation
is assumed to be the element relation. The blocks of a projective
plane must be <strong>sets</strong>.
<p>
The following methods generate a record characterising the projective
plane. As most of the functions in this chapter need this data, the
record returned by <code>ElationPrecalc</code> or <code>ElationPrecalcSmall</code> is the
recommended representation of projective planes. 
<p>
<a name = ""></a>
<li><code>ElationPrecalc( </code><var>blocks</var><code> ) F</code>
<a name = ""></a>
<li><code>ElationPrecalcSmall( </code><var>blocks</var><code> ) F</code>
<p>
Given the blocks <var>blocks</var> of a projective plane, 
<code>ElationPrecalc( </code><var>blocks</var><code> )</code> returns a record conatining 
<dl compact>
 <dt>.points<dd>the points of the projective plane (immutable)
 <dt>.blocks<dd>the blocks as passed to the function (immutable)
 <dt>.jpoint<dd>a matrix with <i>ij</i>-th entry the point meeting the 
    <i>i</i>-th and the <i>j</i>-th block.
 <dt>.jblock<dd>a matrix with <i>ij</i>-th entry the position of the block 
     connecting the point <i>i</i> to the point <i>j</i> in <var>blocks</var>.
</dl>
<p>
<code>ElationPrecalcSmall( </code><var>blocks</var><code> )</code> returns a record which 
does only contain <var>.points</var>, <var>.blocks</var> and <var>.jblock</var>. Hence the name.
<p>
In the following sections, some of the functions have two versions.
The versions which have a <code>Small</code> appended to it's name do not depend
on the data generated by <code>ElationPrecalc</code>, but rather on the data
structure provided by <code>ElationPrecalcSmall</code>. The <code>Small</code> versions are
generally much slower than the other ones.
<p>

<li><code>DualPlane( </code><var>blocks</var><code> ) O</code>
<p>
For a projective plane given by <var>blocks</var>, <code>DualPlane( </code><var>blocks</var><code> )</code> returns
a record containing a set of blocks defining the dual plane and a List 
<var>image</var> containing the same blocks such that <var>image[p]</var> is the image of the
point <var>p</var> under duality.
It is not tested, if the design defined by <var>blocks</var> is actually
a projective plane.
<p>
<a name = ""></a>
<li><code>ProjectiveClosureOfPointSet( </code><var>points</var><code>, </code><var>maxsize</var><code>, </code><var>data</var><code> ) O</code>
<p>
Let <i>P</i> be a projective plane given by the record <var>data</var> as returned by
<code>ElationPrecalcSmall</code>. Let <var>points</var> be a set of points (integers). Then
<code>ProjectiveClosureOfPointSet</code> returns the projective colsure of <var>points</var>
in <i>P</i> (the smallest subplane of <i>P</i> containing the points <var>points</var>). 
The closure is returned as a list of points. 
If <i>maxsize</i>  &#8800; 0, calculations are stopped if the closure is known to
have at least <var>maxsize</var> points and <var>data.points</var> is returned.
Observe that this is a ``small'' function, in the sense that it does not 
need the data from <code>ElationPrecalc</code> but merely the data generated by
<code>ElationPrecalcSmall</code>.
