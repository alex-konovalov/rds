This chapter shows a quick example of how to use <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">RDS</font>. Some of
the functions used here make choices which might not be optimal. So if
you plan to do more involved computations, you should also see the
other chapters to learn about the concepts behind these high-level
functions.
<p>
Here we will construct relative difference sets of Dembowski-Piper type
``b'' and order 9. We will take the elementary abelian group as an
example. The general idea is as follows: Find a ``nice'' normal
subgroup <i>U</i> and generate relative difference sets coset by coset. The
normal subgroup has to be chosen such that we know how many elements
to choose from each coset modulo <i>U</i>.
<p>
The calculations here are very easy, a more demanding example can be found
in chapter <a href="../../rds/htm/C005S000.htm">RDS:An Example Program</a>.
